# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to find the best predictive model for estimating car prices based on various features.

Features

- 1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- 2.Feature Engineering: Analyzing and transforming features to improve model performance.
- 3.Modeling: Implemented Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models to predict car prices.
- 4.Evaluation: Comparing model performance to select the most accurate model.


## Technologies Used:
* Python: For data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
* Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: Numerical computations.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.


## Results
The project demonstrated that Lasso Regression performed better than Linear Regression in predicting car prices, achieving higher accuracy and lower error rates.
